<h3>About Me</h3>
<p></p>
For the past 4 years, I've worked full time as an Arts Administrator in the Greater Boston area with a focus on Management and Marketing. Now I am looking to channel my hard skills and innovation into a career at a startup. 
<p></p>
I've always been in the business of creating something from nothing. Whether that means:
<p></p>
<ul><li>Composing original content for social media marketing</li>
<li>Designing a sales analysis report using advanced Excel features</li>
<li>Conceiving and organizing the first Autism Awareness Week at Brandeis University</li>
<li>Recruiting and managing a team of writers and editors creating web content for SEO</li>
<li>Teaching myself how to play piano and write songs</li>
<li>Developing an award-winning comedy sketch</li>
<li>Turning a crafting hobby into a side-business</li>
<li>Etc., Etc.</li></ul>
<p></p>
While my personal interests and professional experience are eclectic, they all have one thing in common: creativity. 
<p></p>
I create products, experiences, processes -- and I know how to share these creations through clear communication and savvy strategy.
<p></p>
I am looking forward to gaining a whole slew of new skills at SIB, and most importantly, I'm excited to meet the movers and shakers of the Boston startup scene. I can't wait to see what you're creating.
